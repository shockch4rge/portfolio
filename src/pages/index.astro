			<span class="font-bold italic">Inspect Element.</span> As a secondary school student bored in the computer
			lab, I was fidgeting around a website and came across an option named 'Inspect Element'. Curious, I
			clicked it. I was immediately shown the intricate inner workings of the website and my mind was blown,
			completely fascinated by the power and customisibility I possessed. Since then, I've never looked back.

			In my free time, I play various musical instruments, from guitars to pianos and even saxophone (to
			an extent). Recently, I've been jamming with a friend and we plan to start a small band for gigs at
			open mic nights.
		</p>

		<p>
			If I <em>really</em> do have a lot of free time, I like to spend it playing games. I'm thankful for
			growing up the great games like Minecraft. Not old enough to be raised alongside Doom 64 though!
		</p>

		<p>
			I created this portfolio as a way to showcase the journey I've taken so far in my career. The
			'projects' page contains some of my proudest work I've done up to now, with each post detailing an
			overview of the project, overcoming simple-to-difficult roadblocks, and maybe even some cool facts
			about the development process. I delve deep into the challenges I face to understand why they exist
			on an atomic level, rather than slapping a band-aid solution from StackOverflow and calling it a
			day.
