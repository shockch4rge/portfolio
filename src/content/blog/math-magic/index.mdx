For me, one of the killer features that makes TypeScript alluring is its structural type system.
Other languages like Java, Flutter, and Go opt for a nominal type system which brings about its many benefits,
but there some things that are simply **impossible** in other languages whose names do not begin with _'Type'_ and end with _'Script'_.
I'll show you how you can perform arithmetic with types in the most literal of senses. This will be an exciting read!

## Basic arithmetic

So obviously, TypeScript has an arithmetic system:

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}

add(1, 2) // 3
```

Duh, this isn't exciting at all. Luckily, we're not interested in how to add `1 + 2`. Let's peel back more layers.

## Numerical types

Can you guess the types of these variables? Hover over each definition to reveal their answers:

```ts twoslash
let num1 = 10;

const num2 = 3;

const num3 = 1 + 2;
```

If you got all three correct, you already have a head-start in this topic! If you didn't, don't worry - we'll go over why these answers
are the way they are.

### First example

In the first variable, we write `let num1 = 10`. This declares a variable with the value of `10`. Pretty straightforward. The part that
_isn't_, however, comes in the form of its implicit type. TypeScript's strongest aspect, arguably, is its ability to decide whether to infer
types strictly or create a looser definition.

When we declare `let`, we aren't certain that this value stays the same, so TypeScript knows that it is possible to mutate it
in the future. To be safe, TypeScript assigns an implicit `number` type to the variable.

This means that `num1` can be re-assigned _any_ number, as long as its type is `number`. No random strings or arrays allowed!

```ts twoslash
let num = 10;

// @errors: 2322
num = "hello world";

num = 20;
```

### Second example

For the second example, we have a constant, `num2`, with a value of `3`. But this time, its type isn't `number` - it's `3`?!
_Why is this the case?_

This is again another demonstration of TypeScript's type inference, but this time, built on JavaScript principles. TypeScript is
is a superset of JavaScript, which means that hard rules in JS are still applicable here.

In this case, a `const` is immutable, thus TypeScript can narrowly infer its type as `3`.

Now hold on, why is `3` even a type in the first place? Isn't it a _value?_ This is indeed true, except that TypeScript is also
allows certain literal values to act as types. This is a unique and fascinating ability the language possesses, and
is one that can be utilised in many cases.

For example, I could restrict a function argument to allow only certain numbers:

```ts twoslash
const player: MusicControls = {
	setVolume: vol => {},
};

// ---cut---
type MusicControls = {
	setVolume: (volume: 0 | 25 | 50 | 100) => void;
};

// @errors: 2345
player.setVolume(10);
player.setVolume(50);
player.setVolume(100);
```

Pretty inflexible music player, but it shows that numbers are indeed valid types!

### Third example

So in the third example, we end up with the `number` type. But we just learnt that `const` definitions should return their literal value as
a type, so isn't it intuitive for TypeScript to also assign `3` as the type?
On paper, it does match the aforementioned criteria...

At first glance, the difference here isn't easily noticeable. But there's something about TypeScript's compiler to take note of: types are only
evaluated at _**compile-time**_. An arithmetic operation (in this case, addition) is a _**runtime**_ operation.

What this means is that TypeScript actually _has no idea_ what `1 + 2` resolves to at compile time! Therefore, it just infers that the type is of `number`.

<Alert type="info" title="Applying set theory">

Now that you have a little background about implicit type specificity, let's do a little exercise. Why does TypeScript complain about this?

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
const num: 1 = 10;
```

The answer lies within **set theory**, regarding unions. In fact, the previous examples all had to do with set theory!

In TypeScript, `number` is known as **the set that contains any number**, e.g.
1; 20; 1,245; 429,582,157,197.

Think of it this way. `10` is assignable to the `number` set, because `number` contains all possible numbers. But can we
instead assign `number` to `10`?

Short answer is - nope. In this case, `1` is just a set that can only contain one value - `1`. In the example,
we try to assert `10` as `1`, and it fails because of this reason.

</Alert>

## Tuples

Now that we've gotten the basics out of the way, an essential factor of type manipulation is **tuples**.
Tuples are arrays with fixed lengths and determined values, and these guys are extremely powerful in constructing complex types.

<Alert type="warning" title="Tuples aren't 'real'...?">
	There isn't actually a true implementation of a fixed-length array in JavaScript. Rather, TypeScript raises
	type errors if we try to mutate it in any way, giving it the illusion of a tuple. Under the hood, the array
	is still mutable!
</Alert>

Here are the ways to create a tuple, and a definition of an array:

```ts twoslash
const tuple1 = [1, 2, 3] as const;
//    ^?

const tuple2: [1, 2, 3] = [1, 2, 3];
//	  ^?

const array: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
//	  ^?
```

We either use `as const` or assert the value as `[1, 2, 3]` to **really** convince TypeScript that what we declared _is_ in fact a tuple.
This means that its type _and_ value are now the same: `[1, 2, 3]`.

Without it, TypeScript will loosely infer `number[]`, like on the last line.

We also can't modify tuples in any form, and some methods are even omitted by TypeScript:

```ts twoslash
const tuple = [1, 2, 3] as const;

// @errors: 2540 2339
// can't reassign length
tuple.length = 0;

tuple.push(10);
```

### The 'length' property

Okay, so tuples seem pretty rigid. Why are they useful anyway?

Their magic comes from the `length` property. It is `readonly`, so it has a special feature:

```ts twoslash
const tuple = [1, 2, 3] as const;

tuple.length;
//      ^?
```

Remember the `const` examples from earlier? Just like in `const` definitions, the values in tuples are determinate,
so TypeScript can safely assume the length of the tuple - which in this case is typed as `3`.
Compare that to a regular array, where we get `number` instead!

**_How cool is that??_** This opens up a whole new world of possibilities in the type world.

With that, we can get started on implementing addition.

## Creating the \<Add\> type

Our end type should produce a result like this.

```ts
type Three = Add<1, 2>;
//	 ^ 3
```

<Alert type="info" title="Possibly confusing topics ahead">
	We will be using certain features such as recursion, `infer`, and generics pretty heavily ahead. Only
	recursion will be confronted as generics are beyond the scope of this post (it's already pretty long), so
	if you get confused or aren't familiar with those topics, do conduct some research first!
</Alert>

### Type recursion

Majority of what we're about to do involves **recursion**. So let's tackle that first.

In programming languages, recursion is a common way to get a function to execute itself repeatedly until a condition is met. It's useful for
things with arbitrary depth like returning a folder's children, and each child's children as well.

All recursive functions consist of 3 components:

1. The **base case** is a condition that **terminates recursion** to prevent infinite re-execution.
2. **Recursion case(s)** is/are where the **function calls itself with modified arguments**.
3. All recursive functions' outputs **should eventually fulfill the base case.**

For instance, to find the factorial of a number, we can use this function:

```ts twoslash
function factorial(n: number): number {
	// base case
	if (n === 1 || n === 0) return n;

	// recursion case
	return n * factorial(n - 1);
	// eventually reaches 1, which fulfills the base case
}

const result = factorial(4); // 24
```

In TypeScript, we can use recursion on the type layer as well! Though it does work a little differently in terms of syntax.

Let's zoom in on TypeScript's bundled utility type, `Awaited`. It allows us to extract the type of a
`Promise`'s resolved value recursively. Hover over its type definition!

```ts twoslash
/// <reference types="node" />
// ---cut---
type Unwrapped = Awaited<Promise<Promise<Promise<Promise<Promise<number>>>>>>;
//	 ^?
```

We can also make our own crude implementation:

```ts twoslash
type MyAwaited<T> = T extends PromiseLike<infer A> 
	? (A extends PromiseLike<any> 
		? MyAwaited<A> 
		: A) 
	: never;

type Unwrapped = MyAwaited<Promise<Promise<Promise<Promise<Promise<number>>>>>>;
//		^?
```

Let's dissect our `MyAwaited` type:

1. Try to infer the type of `A` if `T` is a `Promise`.
2. If it is, check if `A` is also a `Promise`. This is our **recursion case**.
3. If it is, re-use the type, with `A` as the type argument.
4. If `A` does not extend `Promise`, we return `A`, as our final unwrapped type. This is our **base case**, and also our result.

Now that we've got out of the way, we can move on to the first _real_ step.

### Mapping numbers to tuples

Obviously, we can't just do something like the following to achieve addition. TypeScript will not recogise this as valid code:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1005
type Three = 1 + 2;
```

Things like mathematical operators do not work on the type layer. We need to think outside of the box. 
As we learnt, tuples contain a `length` property with a fixed number type. How can we utilise it?

We can use recursion to 'modify' a tuple. Let's see this in action.

First, let's define a helper type for getting a tuple's length, for ease of use:

```ts twoslash
type Length<T extends any[]> = T["length"];
```

Next, let's make a way to convert numbers to tuples. Here's the concept:

1. We want to define a recursive type
2. An internal counter should increment and be returned when we reach the desired number
3. We need to have a base case to stop recursion

With these points in mind, we'll create a type that does this, step-by-step:

Let's create a type called `MapToTuple`, which takes in a number:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
type MapToTuple<T extends number> = ...
```

It's going to be a recursive function, so want to create our base case and our accumulator -
we'll store that as 'state' via default generic values:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// 0 is an arbitrary value
type MapToTuple<T extends number, Acc extends 0[] = []> = ...
```

The idea is to increase `Acc`, until its length matches `T`.

Next, create the recursion logic:

```ts twoslash
type Length<T extends any[]> = T["length"];
// ---cut---
type MapToTuple<T extends number, Acc extends 0[] = []> = Length<Acc> extends T
	? Acc
	: MapToTuple<T, [...Acc, 0]>;
```

Okay. Let's pause here. What exactly are we doing with `extends`?

Every time we compile the type, we check if the length of `Acc` is the same as `T`. If it is, we return `Acc`, our tuple type. If it's not,
we return `MapToTuple` again, but we do 2 things:

1. Pass `T` as the same argument. This shouldn't change as it's our desired number.
2. We use the spread operator `...` on `Acc` to get its items, then append an extra value. This new value goes into the `Acc` slot.

<Alert type="info" title="The spread operator">
	The spread `...` operator can be used on the type layer too. This gives us the value of a tuple.

	```ts twoslash
		type Arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
		type Arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
		
		type Arr3 = [...Arr1, ...Arr2];
		//	 ^?
	```
</Alert>

If we input a number into `MapToTuple`, this is what we get:

```ts twoslash
type Length<T extends any[]> = T["length"];
type MapToTuple<T extends number, Acc extends 0[] = []> = Length<Acc> extends T
	? Acc
	: MapToTuple<T, [...Acc, 0]>;
// ---cut---
type Hello = MapToTuple<4>;
//   ^?

type World = MapToTuple<8>;
//	 ^?
```

### Summing it all together

We're almost done! Let's collect all of this into one convenient type - `Add`. The final step is to map each of the 2 numbers we want to 
add into a tuple, then concatenate them to get the total length:

```ts twoslash
type Length<T extends any[]> = T["length"];
type MapToTuple<T extends number, Acc extends 0[] = []> = Length<Acc> extends T
	? Acc
	: MapToTuple<T, [...Acc, 0]>;
// ---cut---
type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = Length<[...MapToTuple<A>, ...MapToTuple<B>]>;

type Three = Add<1, 2>;
//	 ^?

type Ten = Add<4, 6>;
//	 ^?
```

And we've done it! We've successfully implemented addition in TypeScript using only types! If this is still confusing to you,
here's a summary of everything we've done so far:

<AddDemo />

We can take it a bit further. Here's a bonus challenge.

## Replicating the Fibonacci sequence

The [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) is a very famous pattern of numbers,
denoted by `Fn = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`, where `n > 1`. It's a very common algorithm example on platforms like LeetCode, where programmers
are often challenged to implement it with various languages. With TypeScript types however, it's a different story!

I encourage you to attempt it yourself. We will re-use our created `Add` component here.

If you're done, let's start off with the type itself:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
type Fibonacci<
	N extends number,
	Sum extends number = 1,
	Prev extends number = 0,
	Counter extends number = 1
> = ...;
```

1. `N` is the number we're inputting. So if we input `4`, we expect to get `3`. With `8`, we expect `21`, etc.
2. `Sum` is similar to `Acc` in our `Add` type. Set initial value to `1`, as the first term in the sequence is 1.
3. `Prev` is the value of previous `Sum`. At `n = 1`, `Prev` should be `0`.
4. `Counter` is just how many times we have to iterate. Once we reach `N`, we stop executing (base case).

The implementation is something like this:

<FibDemo />

Same concept, more complex implementation!

## Limits

If you tinkered around with the code, you might've realised that this implementation of addition is actually quite limited. For example,
let's add `1000` to `1000`:

```ts twoslash
type Length<T extends any[]> = T["length"];
type MapToTuple<T extends number, Acc extends 0[] = []> = Length<Acc> extends T
	? Acc
	: MapToTuple<T, [...Acc, 0]>;
type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = Length<[...MapToTuple<A>, ...MapToTuple<B>]>;
// ---cut---
// @errors: 2589
type Result = Add<1000, 1000>;
```

The code errors out and we get this message! What does it mean exactly?

Even though TypeScript allows recursive types, there is a hard recursion limit of 999 to help prevent
programs from stalling. The only way to get around this is to use a **very very** [complex workaround](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/issues/515)
involving a genius level of string manipulation that my pea-brain cannot comprehend, so this limit is here to stay for the time being!
