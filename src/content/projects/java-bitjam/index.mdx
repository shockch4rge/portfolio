## Introduction

BitJam was a music player app for Android that I developed for a school project in 2021, built with pure Java. This was my first ever
experience with mobile development - and honestly programming in general. This is quite a long post as I spent my novice time here.

In the following months, I decided to revisit the concept and branched it out to a Discord bot, which utilised discord.js' API. Check out
the related post above for it.

## Features

1. Play songs offline, with seeking, shuffling, and repeat available
2. Like/favourite songs, add them to playlists
3. Search for existing songs in library via fuzzy(?) searching
4. Pretty complex animations from a programming newbie (hehe)
5. Google auth and login w/Firebase
6. Firestore database
7. Fragments/ViewModel architecture

### PLAYING MUSIC

The app contained the standard controls for a music player. This included a display of the current song, ability to seek to any section,
pause/play functions, skip to the next track - or go back to the previous one. There were loop and shuffle toggleables as well. Some extra
features were the ability to add songs to a playlist.

I'd been wondering about how a music player worked for a while now, so it was exciting to finally be able to get my hands dirty and
actually make one from scratch.

## The Process

### JAVA IS ACTUALLY...NOT BAD?

As a beginner, I actually _loved_ Java. I thought its strictly-typed system and _'everything is a class'_ approach made so much sense,
and I genuinely think it's a great language for newbies to start programming with; even preferable over JavaScript,
which I think teaches you some of the worst habits ever. It also made it easier to step towards TypeScript -
though it wasn't as smooth as I'd liked, as I had to differentiate between nominal and structural typing.

But still there were so many, many caveats to Java. _So many headaches_.

_'Everything is a class'_ meant that simple stuff like anonymous inner classes required creating a class, access modifiers, and methods -
they all had to be typed out, and it took really long. No wonder the common sentiment amongst programmers was Java being insanely verbose.

I mean, don't even get me started on how to assert non-null objects in Android:

```java title="PureLiveData.java" "NotNull" "NonNull" "requireNonNull"

@NonNull
@NotNull
@Override
public T getValue() {
    return Objects.requireNonNull(super.getValue());
}
```

<figcaption>A `LiveData` superclass that asserted non-null values. Had to declare it 3 times.</figcaption>

<Alert type="info" title="Why does this exist?">
	`PureLiveData` was simply a class that extended Android's `LiveData`. As seen in the above figure, there
	were a lot of areas where one would need to constantly redefine non-null values. This idea came from a
	fellow classmate, Zechariah.
</Alert>

Initialising anonymous inner classes took up a ton of space, even when you didn't need to all use its methods.
Here's an example with Android's animation listeners:

```java {4, 15}
slide_up.setAnimationListener(new Animation.AnimationListener() {
    @Override
    public void onAnimationStart(Animation animation) {
        // empty
    }

    @Override
    public void onAnimationEnd(Animation animation) {
        startActivity(new Intent(SplashActivity.this, SignInActivity.class));
        finish();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAnimationRepeat(Animation animation) {
        // empty
    }
});
```

<figcaption>`onAnimationStart` and `onAnimationRepeat` are unused, but they still have to exist.</figcaption>

### FINDING A DATABASE

After toying around with the local data enough, it was time to face the ultimate challenge: _finding a database_. This was super tricky!
I didn't know which were the most suitable options for my app, but it did eventually boil down to:

1. Using the Android built-in `Room` database
2. Using Firestore

`Room` was a good solution that my friends and I were inclined towards, but we thought we could do better. What if we hooked up
an online database? After searching, we found Firestore.

Integrating Firestore into the app was a fun challenge. Though the project criteria did not require a hosted/serverless database, I'm glad
I took the time to do it! The package provided such a great DX across on Android and it was a breeze to use it. I grasped the concept
of NoSQL and real-time databases very quickly and it was cool to see everything fall into place.

### USER AUTHENTICATION

Managing user accounts was certainly a new one to me. I had no clue how to do so and taking the time to implement my own authentication
method was going to be time-consuming (and also insecure, but I didn't know this). So I did some discussion with my classmates, eventually
coming to Firebase as a possible solution.

Skimming over the implementation, it seemed straightforward enough. Took a few days to hook it up, but eventually I managed to add Google
sign-in! Not to glaze myself, but I was quite proud of this achievement. I could use some data from the account object that Firebase
returned (such as the id) and created my own schema in Firestore (which was the)

### GETTING THE SONGS IN

Feeding songs into the app was quite a significant problem I faced, as I had absolutely no idea how I was
going to do so. I _could_ research about serving content from my own server, but I'd suspected that the deadline wasn't far enough for that
(it wasn't!).

Eventually, I came up with a solution, albeit hacky.

I downloaded various MP3s of songs off YouTube and uploaded the files to Discord. With this, I copied the public-facing CDN link of the
file and pasted it into Firestore. I was using Discord's CDN to serve my own files. This miraculously worked, though I had _zero_ idea
how it even did at the time.

### ADDING PLAYLISTS

```java
public void createNewPlaylist(String title, String songId) {
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist(title);
    db.collection("playlists")
            .add(playlist)
            .addOnSuccessListener(docRef -> addSongToExistingPlaylist(docRef.getId(), songId))
            .addOnFailureListener(e -> Log.w(TAG, "Error adding document", e));
}
```

<Alert type="info" title="Why is there a song id in the parameters?">
	In order to get around some Firestore quirks, creating a new playlist requires the user to include a song
	along with the name of the new playlist. This may seem unintuitive, but it also helps to reduce a
	significant amount of code that might deem unnecessary.

	Liking songs just added to a special default playlist assigned to each user. This is quite common amongst
	music streaming apps!
